speedcal is a calendar-focused task management tool that aims to reduce friction in the planning process for those who optimize their planning processes and workflows. as someone who has tried many many different productivity tools and task management apps (e.g. notion, obsidian, ticktick, paper-based planners, the analogue bullet journal method, google calendar, and digital planners), i've always found that every tool that i tried was just slightly inoptimal for my preferred workflow. 

for myself and many others, some important aspects of a productivity tool that we look for are:
* frictionless event/task injection and modification
* visual organization and distinction between tasks/events
* the option to plan by hour (time-based planning / time blocking)

throughout the past few years, i've used google calendar on and off, to time-block my days when my schedule becomes busier and difficult to manage in my head. recently, i discovered notion calendar, and with its simple interface and relatively frictionless user experience, it has quickly risen in the ranks to become my current favourite calendar and task management app. some of its aspects that i greatly appreciate are:
* the ability to change your default calendar in one click
* event creation and editing is in the right sidebar rather than google calendar's pop-up style creator and full-screen overlay editor, which ends up being a bit clunky and creates friction in event-editing in practice

however, one of the main things i also noticed is that often, when i don't complete a task within the dedicated time-block that i set it to, i don't always want to rearrange all of my time blocks to accommodate for the time difference. instead, it would be immensely helpful to me if I could "check off" completed tasks as a visual indicator of their completion. my current workaround is to either change the colour of a task to visually indicate its completion, or add in a ☑️ emoji into the event's title to do this. however, this still involves several clicks and creates friction in my workflow – and as such, i created speedcal to remedy the friction that i encountered in the currently popular productivity apps.

some features of speedcal are:
* separation of event-style and task-style calendadrs
* one-click to mark completion of tasks
* quick-add feature where you paste a free-form text input of an upcoming date (e.g. "may 25 4-6pm calc midterm") and the event is automatically added to the specified desired calendar (wip)
* one-click default calendar switch for planning certain events/time-blocking in bulk (wip)
